# CSCI490-Project

This repository is for a project I am working on at University for CSCI 490, a Data Visualization course. For this project, I am presenting the precipitation, snow water equivalent, and air/soil temperatures across the state of Nevada over the course of 25 years from 1994 to 2021.
